      <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
      <p>
        In this website development, I used ChatGPT and ClaudeAI to support code
        debugging and optimisation and assist with code writing and
        productivity, particularly to help suggest code snippets and/or refactor
        existing code. I critically reviewed and edited all AI-generated content
        to ensure it reflects my own understanding and perspective. I have
        applied the GenAI and MT Usage Framework to ensure my use of these tools
        supports my learning objectives and adheres to academic integrity
        standards.
